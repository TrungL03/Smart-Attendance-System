# Smart-Attendance-System
Develop a classroom management and attendance application using QR codes. Lecturers can create classes and sessions, and the system automatically generates a QR code for each session. Students use the app/web to scan the QR code and check in for attendance. Data is stored in a database, with statistical reports available for lecturers.
